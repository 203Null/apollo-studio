Apollo Studio is a work-in-progress MIDI processing DAW for the lightshow aspect of the Novation Launchpads. The core workflow borrows a lot from Ableton Live's concepts and improves upon them. It supports all 3 major OSes (Windows, macOS and Linux).

The core features are mostly finished, with some minor concepts lacking implementations. We have begun beta testing while we work on bringing features and fixing bugs. This is currently usable by an end-user and backwards-compatible, which means long-term work on projects is possible.
